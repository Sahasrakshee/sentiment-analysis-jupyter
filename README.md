# sentiment-analysis-jupyter-bert
This Jupyter Notebook implements sentiment analysis on user reviews using a BERT-based model. 
The notebook covers text preprocessing, BERT tokenization, model fine-tuning, and prediction, 
classifying reviews into three sentiment classes: **Negative**, **Neutral**, and **Positive**. 
It demonstrates how transformer-based models can effectively capture contextual meaning in text 
for accurate sentiment classification.
