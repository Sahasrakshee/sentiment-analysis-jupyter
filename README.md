# sentiment-analysis-jupyter-bert
This project implements sentiment analysis on user reviews using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art transformer-based model for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of the project is to automatically analyze user opinions and classify each review into one of three sentiment categories:

Negative

Neutral

Positive

Unlike traditional machine learning models, BERT understands the context and meaning of words in a sentence, making it highly effective for sentiment classification tasks.
